## SP-Sass

A generic starting point for Sass that I often use when starting projects. Essentially
a home-grown Sass boilerplate, however basic it may be. 

## Reasoning

- Organization
- Directory structure
- Base styles
- Minimal bloat

## Notes

- I prefer .sass syntax
- @import directives haven't been working with Gulp sass (which I often use), so
  relevant files are in .scss
- The syntax skins are for Highlight.js. Comment/uncomment to toggle.
- Refactors that can hopefully be considered improvements to happen frequently.
